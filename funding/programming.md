## Arts Restoring Community (ARC) Referendum Funding

Following the Arts Restoring Community (ARC) Referendum passed during
the 2014 USAC Elections, the Cultural Affairs Commission (CAC) was
allocated over $100,000 to provide for arts and cultural groups, up from
just $15,000 covered by the CAC mini fund in previous years. Under the
previous system, it was reported that student groups applied for up to
$50,000 in funding in spite of the $15,000 CAC was able to offer. As
such, this expanded budget will greatly improve the scope and extent to
which CAC will be able provide for the needs of student groups.

The Arts Restoring Community (ARC) Referendum Funding can be used by any
registered, undergraduate student group on campus to fund programs.
These programs must be cultural in nature, either promoting cultural
diversity and/or awareness. The Cultural Programming fund should be used
only as a last resort AFTER you have applied to other funding sources.
Allocated funds can ONLY finance honorariums, venues, and supplies for
your program.

**Please complete the application and electronically submit it to
<cacarcfund@asucla.ucla.edu> with proper documentation.**

## Bruin Advocacy Grant

The Bruin Advocacy concept is to provide students and organizations with
the scope, contacts, experience, and funds to take command over their
own issues and bring these issues directly to those with the immediate
power to realize change. Our office also provides advocacy training,
political strategy development, and contact sharing with program
applications through an appointed liaison, to ensure that a group
receives not only funding, but also the tools necessary for successful
advocacy.

Bruin Advocacy Grant applications should be submitted to the EVP office
mailbox (Kerckhoff Hall 300C) by 3:00pm on Fridays no later than five
(5) weeks prior to the program. If you have any questions, email
<usac.evp.bruindefendersdir@gmail.com>.
