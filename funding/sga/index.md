# Student Government Accounting - Overview

The Student Government Accounting (SGA) office manages financial matters
related to the funding of the Undergraduate Student Association.

Currently, the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) has over 700
student group/departments in our database, alone. As an effort to aid
the student groups/departments, we have placed as many documents, forms,
instructions and PowerPoint Presentations on this website for your
convenience. For example: [How To Fill Out a
Req](/docs/req-howto.pdf).

The Student Government Accounting office uses the [<span
class="underline">General Requisition
Form</span>](/funding/sga/req) to process the expenditures of
each student group/department, and student government office.

USA's funds can be utilized through 4 main methods:

- [Purchase
    Orders](/funding/sgahandbook/obtain_po.php)
- [<span
    class="underline">Honorariums</span>](/funding/sgahandbook/honorariums.php)
- [Cash
    Advances](/funding/sgahandbook/cash_advances.php)
- [<span
    class="underline">Reimbursements</span>](/funding/sgahandbook/pers_reimburse.php)

Student groups are granted funds through the process of proposals and
hearings. After funds are granted, the funds are transferred into the
student group's account (sometimes referred to as a department) in the
SGA office.

For USA, the different funding sources would include:

[Programming](/funding/programming):

- Contingency
- Capital Contingency
- Academic Affairs Mini Grants
- ASUCLA Board of Directors (BOD/USA) Programming Fund
- CS Mini Fund

Once funds have been allocated to your student group, in order to access
your account a general requisition must be submitted, or a REQ for
short. Each req much be completely filled out with the appropriate
signatures, necessary information, your [21
digit account number](/docs/accounthelp.pdf), and the required
attachments.
