# Documents

As your student government, USAC has a number of rules and regulations which govern its actions.  In this documentation section, you can find links to every governing document and rule that guides us, as well as complete and updated minutes detailing the contents of our weekly meetings.

In "**Guiding**," you will find our Undergraduate Students Association Constitution, as well as the rules and guidelines for many of our various committees, including Elections Board, Judicial Board, and the Office Space Allocation Committee.

Under "**Applications**," you access numerous opportunities to get involved in leadership through USAC.  This consists mostly of applications for the 13 different offices of USAC, as well as presidential appointed positions to a wide variety of campus committees.

"**Minutes**" contains all the minutes from our weekly meetings so that anyone can follow or reference the proceedings of our legislative body.

"**Bylaws**" contains all eight articles of our USA Bylaws,  which are a more detailed explanation of the rules and regulations governing all USAC entities.  Unlike our constitution, the bylaws can be amended at any time by a 2/3 vote of Council, and they frequently are.

"**Resolutions**" contains all of the Resolutions passed by USAC from 2010-2011 on.

"**Clarifications**" contains Clarification of Facts deemed necesary by USAC from 2010-2011 on.

Under "**Historical**," you can look back on various historical documents from the recent and not so recent past.
