## Design Comments

*Rohit Vighne:* <q>In this complete overhaul of the USAC website, I retired the UCLA Gateway Template (as seen on many campus websites, including UCLA.edu) in favor of a custom design. I sought to bring in simplicity and modern design values, while using colors and elements shared with the ASUCLA and UCLA.edu websites to create ties with the organizations we are a part of. One of the major areas of improvement is in the organization of documents, which are now indexed automatically by the website instead of manually entered by the webmaster. This ensures that links to documents are reliable and up-to-date.</q>

*Logan Cai:* <q>One of my goal in the USAC website design was to provide fast access to frequently access content. By placing the budget report, minutes and agenda right on the front page we have reduced the numer of clicks a user needs to perform. The header photos located in each section of the website was carfully choosen to showcase the beauty of Kerckhoff Hall while retaining relevance to the section. For example, the "About" header image showcases Kerchoff Hall staircase. The staircase leads to the student government offices. Similarly the "Funding" header image staircase leads to the Student Government Accounting office. The UCLA Undergraduate Students Association header was changed from a PNG to a SVG to ensure the upmost clarity for high pixel density displays.</q>
