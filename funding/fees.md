# USAC Budget Student Fees Overview

Understanding where your student fees go can be confusing. These graphics, created by USAC Office of the President Affordability Team 20-21, can help explain how the USAC budget is composed of compulsory student fees (also known as referenda fees). These are student fees that were voted on and passed by the student body, and are overseen by the Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC). Some fees, especially those passed in more recent academic years, are adjusted to CPI each year and may change the total amount collected from the undergraduate student body. The breakdown featured below illustrates one academic quarter of student fee collection.
