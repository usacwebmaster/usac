## Bruin Defenders Grant

The Bruin Defenders concept is to provide students and organizations
with the scope, contacts, experience, and funds to take command over
their own issues and bring these issues directly to those with the
immediate power to realize change. Our office also provides advocacy
training, political strategy development, and contact sharing with
program applications through an appointed liaison, to ensure that a
group receives not only funding, but also the tools necessary for
successful advocacy.

Bruin Defenders Grant applications should be submitted to the EVP office
mailbox (Kerckhoff Hall 300C) by 3:00pm on Fridays no later than five
(5) weeks prior to the program. If you have any questions, email
<usac.evp.bruindefendersdir@gmail.com>.
