# Stipend Guidelines: A FEW IMPORTANT FACTS

1. Individuals must be continuously enrolled at UCLA for at least 4 units each quarter.
2. Individuals must maintain a 2.0 GPA.
3. No individual may receive more than one stipend nor both work study and a stipend if the stipend is funded by the USA (i.e. a stipend from more than one USA account and/or University account).
4. No person approved by USAC after the 7th week of any quarter shall receive a retroactive stipend. Persons approved after the 7th week shall receive a stipend for the period commencing on the date of their approval.
