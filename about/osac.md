## Student Organization Resources

A. good place to start looking for items such as funding is at the [Programming Funds Search tool](/funding/programming). You might also find out [how to fill out a requisition form](/docs/req-howto.pdf).

The IVP website has an entire [list of resource guides](https://ivp.ucla.edu/Guides/) that are extremely helpful for student organizations, ranging from <q>How to Manage Your Apps</q> to <q>Starting a Club at UCLA</q>.

Another office of USAC, the Facilities Commission, has compiled a [<q>Web Accessibility</q> Resource guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GTdRJH5-u4mdIY9JoO0I5P_eHnP4wDY-H_VpwsDhwAk/edit). This is an excellent guide to ensuring that your student organization's posts, graphics, and communication methods are accessible.
