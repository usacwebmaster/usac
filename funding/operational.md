# Operational Funding Documents

The **Student Organizations Operational Fund (SOOF) provides funding for retreats, graphics, assistance, advertising, and supplies. SOOF funds may not be used for any type of programming or capital items.** Please note the following guidelines for SOOF funding that are currently in effect for the 2012-2013 school year:

The maximum amount any one group may apply for is $3,000 dollars. No matter what amount a group applies for, it is not possible to determine the amount they will get for Assistance/Stipends because that amount is dependent on the scores the funding committee gives to each group.
