## Campus Life Support for Student Programming (SSP) Fund

The Campus Life Support for Student Programming (SSP) fund offers
multiple funding sources that support various costs of student
programming. A single application covers all funding opportunities.
Between the multiple funding sources, funds exist to offset direct costs
related to the use of on-campus venues, such as staffing, custodial,
equipment, audio-visual and sound equipment, and other requested
incidentals related to the use of campus space. In addition,
supplemental funding is also available to cover services associated with
on-campus events including, but not limited to: food/refreshments,
related disposable supplies, and on-campus advertising through student
media.
